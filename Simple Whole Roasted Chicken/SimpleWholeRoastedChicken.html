    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Roast chicken is chicken prepared as food by roasting whether in a home
      kitchen, over a fire, or with a rotisserie.
    </p>
    <p>
      A whole chicken is seasoned with a sweet and savory dry spice rub made
      with allspice, cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon. This combination of unique
      ingredients makes this chicken dish delicious! It does need to marinate in
      the fridge for 24 hours, but it roasts beautifully and surprisingly fast
      once in the oven
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
      <li>
          ⅛ teaspoon ground cloves
      </li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon ground allspice</li>
      
      <li>
          ⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg
      </li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      
      <li>1 (4 pound) whole chicken</li>
      <li>5 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix salt, sugar, cloves, allspice, nutmeg, and cinnamon together in a small bowl until combined. Rub chicken all over with spice mixture. Transfer chicken to a large bowl, cover, and refrigerate for 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place chicken, breast-side down, on a rack in a roasting pan. Stuff chicken cavity with crushed garlic.</li>
        <li>Roast chicken in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) and continue roasting for 15 minutes more. Baste chicken with pan drippings; reduce heat to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) and continue roasting for 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and allow to rest in a warm area for 20 minutes before slicing.</li>
