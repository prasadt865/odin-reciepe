    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Remove and discard skin from chicken pieces. Cut slits into meat and place into a shallow dish. Season chicken on both sides with lemon juice and salt. Let sit for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix yogurt, onion, garlic, garam masala, ginger, and cayenne pepper together in a medium bowl until smooth, then stir in food coloring.</li>
        <li>Spread yogurt mixture over chicken, cover, and refrigerate for 6 to 24 hours (the longer the better).
        </li>
        <li>When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove chicken from marinade. Discard remaining marinade.</li>
        <li>Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink and the juices run clear. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Garnish with cilantro and lemon wedges.</li>
